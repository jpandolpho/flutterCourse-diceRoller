# Dice Roller

This Flutter project was made following the course "Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2024 Edition]", available in https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/.

## Description

In the second section of the course, the objective was getting a solid foundation for developing Flutter/Dart applications.

To accomplish that, a simple Dice Rolling App was created, where a one of the six sides of a dice is presented and, when a button is pressed, the dice is rolled. After the roll, the presented dice is updated to reflex the correct value that was rolled.

## Additional Work

There is a branch in this project called "doubleDice". It is a version of the app where, as you might have guessed, we roll two dices instead of one. That's just it.
